# build-tools

Created Maven projects and pom.xml files for maven buils
The build_maven.bat file contains steps to install the admin.jar and web.war artifacts in your local .m2 repository, before listing down the content of the two result artifacts

To see the build results, simply run build_maven.bat

Not going to include as of now: gradle and ant build scripts
